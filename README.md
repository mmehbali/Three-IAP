### Heuristics for solving the axial Three-index Assignment Problem. 

Please bear in mind that all code in this project is written using Python 3.9 and you need to use Jupyter to run it!

### About the Data:

1. The file "Sample 1.zip" contains Balas and Saltzman 1991 Dataset. 
2. The file "Sample 2.zip" contains Random Data size 5, 10, 15, ..., 35 uniformally generated.
3. The file "Sample 3.zip"contains Random Data size 5, 10, 15, ..., 100 uniformally generated, including the Sample 2 data.

### How to Run the Code:

1. You need to make sure that all packages are installed correctly.
2. You need to make sure that you the data is saved on your machine (unzip the compressed files).
3. Make sure you update the data path and filename in the Jupyter notebook.
4. In the Jupyter notebook, you can go to Cell -> Run All and the code should run smoothly!
5. Please open a github issue if something is not clear or doesn't work correctly.
